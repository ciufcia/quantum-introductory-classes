# 🧠 Quantum Computing Basics for High School Students

The repository is designed to introduce high school students to the foundational mathematics and concepts behind **quantum computing**.

This collection of Jupyter Notebooks presents key Maths topics leading to the challenge of writing the first quantum programme. Each notebook explains a core concept with both theory and Python examples to build intuition and computational skills.

## 📚 Contents

- `vectors.ipynb`  
  Introduction to vectors as mathematical objects, with operations, visualizations, and connections to quantum states.

- `complex_numbers.ipynb`  
  Explains complex numbers, their geometric interpretation, polar form, and how they relate to wave behavior and qubits.

- `matrices.ipynb`  
  Covers matrix operations, identity, transposition, and their use in quantum gates and transformations.

## 👩‍🏫 Purpose

This project is meant for:
- High school students (or beginners) exploring quantum computing
- Teachers preparing engaging STEM lessons
- Anyone curious about the mathematical language behind quantum systems

## ✨ Goals

By working through these notebooks, students will:
- Develop strong intuition about vectors, complex numbers, and matrices
- Understand how these topics form the building blocks of quantum computation
- Be ready to explore qubits, quantum gates, and quantum algorithms
